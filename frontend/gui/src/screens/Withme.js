              I love collaborating with people that share a similar mission and
              values as me! Having a background in Psychology and Music, I speak
              that language and understand the importance of the right messaging
              and calls to action.{" "}

              I am open minded and a continuous learner. Our work could range
              from flute tutorial sessions to content creating. I am passionate
              to serve my community, and very selective about the things I end
              up working on.{" "}

              You come from a musical classical background, and you kind of
              follow the rules according to that, but also you follow an own
              path and you document it all. Its pretty unique. And you have that
              kind of never ceasing flame, which only you seem to feel it burns
              for or in what direction.{" "}
