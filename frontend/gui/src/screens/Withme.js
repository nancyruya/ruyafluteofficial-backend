              I love collaborating with people that share a similar mission and
              values as me! Having a background in Psychology and Music, I speak
              that language and understand the importance of the right messaging
              and calls to action.{" "}

              I am open minded and a continuous learner. Our work could range
              from flute tutorial sessions to content creating. I am passionate
              to serve my community, and very selective about the things I
              end up working on.{" "}
