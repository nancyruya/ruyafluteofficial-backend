          Abstract Residential mobility and its effect on mental health is
          reviewed. Prolonged and intense stress is an essential factor to
          predict negative emotional outcomes. Both the brain’s ability to adapt
          to stress and the stressors that exist in the environment after moving
          vary the degree of stress felt. The findings support that stress
          associated with relocation is higher for women and for the individuals
          who see social networks change, and the effects of stress on negative
          mental health outcomes are stronger for introverts. Other factors,
          such as age differences and individual self conceptions, may also
          contribute to the stressors and thus have negative mental health
          outcomes after residential moves. Moving is associated with negative
          mental health outcomes but people do not acknowledge the psychological
          effects behind moving. It is necessary for more movers and researchers
          to be aware of this issue in order to develop strategies to buffer
          against the psychological costs of moving. As the world is getting
          more and more mobile, people change residences more frequently in
          search of prosperity, political freedom, or happiness (Oishi, 2010).
          The U.S. Census Bureau (2014) reported that the most common reasons
          for people to move was that they wanted a new or better home, which is
          14.8%. Statistics showed that the U.S. had the highest percent of
          people who had moved within the past five years, which is 21% of the
          total national population, whereas countries like China and Venezuela
          was less than 5% (Esipova, Pugliese, & Ray, 2013). Another data by
          U.S. Census Bureau (B, 2015) showed that even though the percent of
          movers had been decreasing, the number of movers are increasing. The
          reason why the number of movers are increasing is because there are
          more people coming to America. The data show that the U.S. is one of
          the most mobile counties in the world. Even though moving houses seems
          very common in people’s lives especially in America, housing mobility
          and its effect on development has received limited research attention
          in psychology. This may because people do not take time to consider
          their emotional feelings while planning on movings; as well as
          conducting psychological experiment about moving and its psychological
          influences on emotions might be difficult to achieve nowadays due to
          ethical issues. Therefore, the effect of moving residences on
          individuals’ mental health remains unknown. In this paper, the effects
          of varied stressors on individuals’ well-being in different social
          interactions during residential moves will be examined. I will argue
          that stress mediate residential mobility on negative mental health
          outcomes. More specifically, gender, personality, and social
          relationships moderate the individual’s stress. Furthermore, the
          stress of relocation is higher for women and for individuals who
          perceive social networks change, and the effects of stress on negative
          mental health outcomes are stronger for introverts. Residential
          mobility is a stressful life event. People move residences to pursue a
          better future but underestimate the hidden stressor that exist in the
          new environment that could affect emotional health. It is important
          for people to be more aware of what is happening on emotional health
          during and after the moves, so that it can help people be aware of the
          strategies for movers to buffer themselves against the psychological
          costs of moving, as well as develop social awareness and let people
          understand the dynamic between individuals, groups and communities.
          Oishi (2010) presents a social network model of residential mobility,
          which postulates the relationships between residential mobility and
          people’s well-being. The model contains two pathways, in the first
          pathway, moving itself directly influence one’s well-being. In the
          second pathway, housing mobility affects the characteristics
          (openness/mobility) of one’s “social networks”, which in turn
          influence one’s well-being. “Social network” is one’s network of
          social interaction and interpersonal relationships. It is impacted by
          one’s familiarity in his/her environment. The more open and mobile the
          social networks are, the more frequently people move, and also the
          more unstable the environment is. Oishi’s first pathway suggests that
          moving houses could directly influence one’s well-being. This may be
          due to the fact that residential relocation always involves adaptation
          and is thus a stressful life event. People often complain about
          packing and unpacking personal belongings during the moves and leaving
          familiar surroundings and neighbors, as well as stress about settling
          down in a new place (Stokols & Shumaker, 1982). People respond to the
          stress differently during the moves, which leads to different outcomes
          of well-being. Oishi’s second pathway claims that moving houses
          establishes “social networks”. New social networks lead to a changing
          of social groups and relationships. As the level of change in one’s
          surroundings and social relationships increases, the more open and
          mobile of the new social networks are, and therefore the more
          stressors are presented. However, the more similar the surroundings
          are in the new location compared with the old one, the social networks
          are less open and the less stressors are presented. Therefore, moving
          leads to different social networks that present different stressors,
          as well as the new stressors affects individual’s adaptation of stress
          differently which leads to different individual well-being outcomes.
          In another word, both “the degree of openness of social networks” and
          “individual’s brain adaptation to stress” affects the individual’s
          well-being. Stressors and Emotions Brain Adaptations Stress can be
          described as the experiences that are emotionally and physiologically
          challenging (McEwen, 2007). Stress occurs when the experience places
          demands on individuals which exceed their coping abilities and
          threaten their well-being (Lazarus, 1966). When stress is temporary
          and under control because it helps with accomplishing tasks, then the
          stress is adaptive. However, stress can be maladaptive and problematic
          for health when it is intense and prolonged, and could more likely
          lead to illness and chronic mental health issues (Stokols & Shumaker,
          1982). In order to know how stress affects emotion in the brain, we
          need to look at the theories of emotion. Schachter-Singer (1962)
          theory is an example of cognitive theory of emotion, which had been
          widely used in the present research. It suggests that emotions occurs
          based on physiological responses after perceiving stressors, and the
          messages are carried from the body to the brain where they do the
          cognitive interpretation and label the emotions. When applying
          cognitive theories of emotion to housing mobility, people would first
          physiologically respond to the stressors (that come from moving
          houses) and then their cognitive interpretation of the stressful
          situation differentiate individual’s emotions. For example, when
          people experienced beating hearts after a move, some people may
          interpret the physiological reaction was due to anxiety, but other may
          interpret it as exciting and positive feelings. Therefore, some movers
          may perceive moving as a happy event because they get a chance to know
          more people and learn new things. But, some people may perceive it as
          a stressful event, because they have very a difficult time getting out
          of their comfort zones. The way the individual’s brain responds or
          adapts to the stressor varies, and the degree of stress levels are
          differentiated. McEwen and Gianaros (2010) argue that stressful
          experiences, over a long term, could have a negative effect on mental
          health. Chronic stress is known to lead to disturbed regulatory
          systems, which is a phenomenon also known as allostatic load.
          Allostatic systems enable individuals to cope with stressful events,
          and the brain is the central organ to regulates allostasis. Once the
          brain cannot adapt to the stress because of the malfunctioning of the
          allostatic system, allostatic load is built and thus affect people’s
          mental health (McEwen & Gianaros, 2010). A study showed that stress in
          a pregnant mother could affect fetal development and outcomes
          (Kinsella & Monk, 2009). Marin et al. (2011) found that stress is
          associated with the development of some major mental health problems
          including depression, PTSD, and pathologic aging. Therefore, if people
          who are experiencing intense and prolonged stress during their
          frequent residential moves, the chronic stress could lead to negative
          mental health outcomes, and thus affect their own lives and others’ as
          well. Social Relationships Not only the brain’s adaptations lead to
          different levels of stress, social relationships among the movers
          would affect their degree of stress as well. Tend and Befriend Theory
          suggests that humans’ social relationships are a primary resource for
          dealing with stressful circumstances (Taylor, 2011). The theory claims
          that taking care of (tending) offspring and affiliating with others
          (befriending) are common responses in humans when facing threats. When
          a threat is located, human beings are more likely to unite together
          and offer each other help rather than attacking. If human beings have
          a supportive and comforting social relationship, stress can be
          buffered and stress responses decline; however, if social
          relationships are unsupportive, the psychological stress responses
          increase (Taylor, 2011). This can also apply to the second pathway of
          Oishi (2010)’s social networks model (as we mentioned earlier), which
          claims that the degree of openness of social network would lead to
          different well-being outcomes. Therefore, we can predict that if the
          social networks are more open, such as people move more frequently,
          the movers would have weaker social ties with others in their new
          surroundings. This means that they would have more difficulties
          dealing with stress, and are more likely to develop mental health
          problems. Moderators that Impact Degree of Stress During Moves In
          seeing how individuals respond to stressors, past research supports
          that stress can be varied by different factors. Social environment,
          gender, personalities and other factors can vary the degree of stress
          during residential moves and lead to different well-being outcomes.
          First, social environment, including both the locations of where
          people move and family instability, affect people’s mental health
          differently because of the different levels of stress are presented in
          the new environment(Adams & Chase-Lansdale, 2002; Wang & Mesman,
          2015). People are under more stress, if they move to a completely
          culturally different area or experience parents separation while
          moving than moving within the communities and stable families. Second,
          housing mobility has more effect on women than men because women rely
          more on social support to buffer their stress while moving, and moving
          disrupt women’s social support systems (Magdol, 2002; Taylor, 2011).
          Third, personality differences affect stress levels, such that
          introverts who had moved frequently as children had higher levels of
          stress than extraverts later in their lives (Oishi & Schimmack, 2010;
          Oishi, Krochik, Roth, & Sherman, 2012). There are other factors
          regarding age differences and individual’s self concepts, and their
          relationship with stress will be discussed in this section as well.
          Social Environment Location. A meta-analytic review conducted by Wang
          and Mesman (2015) analyzed empirical studies that give insights into
          the emotional adaptation of rural children who migrated to urban areas
          in China. The research found that migrant children showed more
          problems in emotional functioning than local urban children. Larger
          studies demonstrated that rural migrant children have lower emotional
          well-being than local children. Three main issues were analyzed that
          attributed to emotional disfunction after moving in this meta-analytic
          review: acculturation, discrimination, and economic pressures.
          Acculturation stress means that the challenges for the individual that
          accompany attempts to adapt to a new culture cause stress (Berry,
          Phinney, Sam, & Vedder, 2006). Given that rural to urban migrants
          often result in a loss of social networks and culture shocks,
          acculturation stress is built. Discrimination is a type of social
          categorization and allows people to apply their knowledge about
          certain groups to new people (Bruner, 1957). There is substantial
          evidence that migrant children in China face individual discrimination
          because of their rural accents or their clothing styles (Li, 2007).
          Economic pressure is most likely to cause migrant families stress.
          Studies showed that low economic resources leads to stress in migrant
          families and the stressed parents influence children’s psychological
          development (Conger & Donnellan, 2007; Emmen et al., 2013).
          Psychological theories and studies regarding acculturation,
          discrimination, and economic pressures faced by migrant families in
          China all lead to heightened stress levels in both the parents and the
          children. They are more likely to build chronic stress, which lead to
          allostatic load and thus affect children’s emotional well-being. These
          findings imply that people who move to culturally different areas,
          where the local residences have more characteristic and status
          differences from the movers’ original community, may experience more
          stressors and have more negative mental health effects than people who
          move within a similar communities. The study also seems to suggest
          that moving affect people’s mental health across many diverse cultures
          and backgrounds. More research would need to be done, perhaps
          comparing moving from rural-urban areas of Eastern and Western
          cultures to see if people are affected differently in one area over
          another. Additionally, the unstable status of the families while
          moving, such as parents’ divorces and violences, can be also more
          stressful than healthy families. Family instability. Family
          instability paired with residential mobility has more negative effects
          on emotional outcomes than stable family experiencing residential
          mobility alone. Family instability is defined to include factors such
          as family housing mobility, marriage or divorce, parental illness or
          addiction, family violence, parental employment changes, and
          proportion of time spent in poverty (Adams & Chase-Lansdale, 2002;
          Cavanagh and Fomby, 2012; Forman and Davies, 2003). A study by Adams
          and Chase-Lansdale (2002) found that family instability has a
          significant negative influence on children’s well-being. The study
          examined the association between a history of family instability and
          adjustment problems in adolescent girls. It focused on parental
          separations (numbers of separations from or losses of important
          caregivers in the child’s life) and residential mobility (number of
          changes in physical residences). Participants were 267 African
          American female adolescents and their female caregivers living in
          high-poverty neighborhoods. Adolescents reported their number of
          residential moves in the last 5 years. The results showed a
          significant positive association between residential mobility and
          adolescent adjustment problems, and paternal separations with
          adjustment problems. The study also showed a greater number of past
          moves significantly predicted worse adjustment problems. The number of
          parental separations were significantly associated with greater
          adjustment problems compared to housing mobility alone. Fowler, et.
          al. (2015) also found a similar result that housing mobility in
          adolescence predicted poorer functioning across outcomes in young
          adulthood, and youth living in multigenerational homes exhibited
          greater likelihood to be arrested than adolescents in stable families.
          These finding suggests that frequent moving causes children to
          increase their problems in emotional functioning. Moreover, children
          who experience moving because of family separations are more
          negatively affected than children who experience moving without family
          separation. It is known that social environment can cause different
          levels of stress during the moves, now fixing social environment and
          see how individuals perceive the stressors after moving. It is
          suggested that gender differences might interpret stressors
          differently. Gender Magdol (2002) used existing data and analyses in a
          representative sample to reexamine the negative psychological effects
          of residential mobility on men and women. He sought explanations for
          gender differences to move beyond description by the advance stress
          theory. Two approaches were considered in the analyses: mobility
          events expose women to more stress, which leads to mobile women
          experiencing more stress than mobile men; the second approach is that
          women respond to stress differently which leads them to higher levels
          of stress. The data were collected by The National Survey of Families
          and Households in America in 1988 (Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988).
          Among the 10,008 respondents, social class, race, age, marital status,
          gender, mobility, and employment status were rated. Psychological
          well-being was measured in three differential exposures. The first
          result shows that women had higher depression scores than men did on
          average. Women also did more household tasks and were more likely to
          live with children. The second result shows that there are gender
          differences in the effect of mobility that is not dependent on the
          gender differences in depression. In other words, residential mobility
          has differential negative psychological effects on men and women, and
          the effect is not dependent on depression. The third result shows that
          three mediators (housework and childcare) had greater negative
          psychological effects. This mean that spending more time on housework
          and living with children were all predictors of more stress. These
          analyses show that moving is gendered, and is a factor that
          contributes to gender differences in negative psychological affects.
          The study partially supported that women experience more
          mobility-related stress. The impact of social contact and increased
          kin distance on depression is greater for women, which means that
          moving predicts higher distress after moving away from a supportive
          social environment. Even though the data was collected in a relatively
          older period of time and the social structure has been changing
          dramatically nowadays, the research still suggests that movers under
          this specific group of people or cultures (women responsible for
          housework and childcare) experience more stress while moving than men.
          Recent theories (e.g. Tend and Befriend Theory) also support that
          women experience more stress than men during the residential moves.
          Tend and befriend responses may be more responsive to stress among
          women than men (Taylor, 2011). According to human evolution, men were
          responsible for fighting and women were responsible for childcare and
          foraging. As a result, when facing threat, it was beneficial that
          women affiliate with the social group to protect both themselves and
          their offspring. Whereas men have more of fight or flight behavior
          because they do not need to care much about their offspring around
          them when they hunt outside home. This does not suggest that tend and
          befriend responses are only for women. Study showed women are somewhat
          more likely to seek social support in response to stress than men
          (Tamres, Janicki, & Helgeson, 2002), because they are more invested in
          their social networks (Taylor, 2011), and the finding can be
          generalized across many cultures (Edwards, 2002). Therefore, stress
          from moving could affect men and women differently because of their
          different perspectives on social relationships. In looking closely at
          the neurological side of stress adaptation in the body, personalities
          showed different mental health outcomes in responding stress after
          moving. Personality Oish and Schimmack (2010) found that introverts
          who move frequently in childhood show lower self-reported well-being
          and higher rates of mortality in adulthood, whereas this was not
          applicable for extroverts. To build on this study and see what exactly
          happened between introverts and extroverts in moving, Oishi, Krochik,
          Roth, and Sherman (2012) explored the possibility by comparing
          introverts’ and extroverts’ daily outputs of cortisol. Cortisol is the
          “stress hormone”, and it is released to respond stress (McEwen &
          Gianaros, 2010). They also consider culture as a possible moderator in
          their findings. The study by Oishi et. al. (2012) was conducted among
          147 college participants, including 41 students from European America,
          33 African Americans, and 46 Asian Americans. They were first asked to
          complete life satisfaction surveys. They indicated how often they had
          felt positive (PA: happy and cheerful) and negative emotions (NA: sad
          and upset) during the past month. They also completed a self esteem
          scale, loneliness, and personality trait surveys. After completing
          self-report tasks, participant’s salivary cortisol sample were
          collected for specific times throughout the day. The result from
          self-report survey shows that European American participants are more
          satisfied with their lives. They experience more PA than NA, higher
          levels of self-esteem, and are more extraverted than Asian American
          participants. From the collection of cortisol samples, result shows
          the higher total cortisol output has positive correlation with NA on
          European American participants’ experiences. Total cortisol output was
          negatively associated with self-esteem and openness to accepting new
          things among European American participants. The analysis from the
          two-way interaction between residential mobility and well-being shows
          that frequent childhood moves predicted NA among introverts.
          Residential moves were positively associated with loneliness among
          introverts, but negatively associated among extraverts. They also
          found a significant interaction between residential mobility and NA
          among European Americans. From the interaction between mobility and
          cortisol output, childhood residential mobility was positively
          associated with total cortisol output among introverts, but not among
          extroverts. Thus, combining with previous results, residential
          mobility causes introverts to experience more NA and loneliness and
          also involves greater daily cortisol output, at least for European
          Americans. Oishi et. al. (2012) did not find such significant results
          in African Americans or Asian Americans, and it was suggested that
          they might have different ways of coping with the challenges from
          childhood residential mobility due to different cultural backgrounds.
          This study gives a closer view about housing mobility and its effect
          on different personalities in the body. In addition to residential
          mobility having a negative effect on well-being among introverts,
          childhood mobility leads to negative effects for introverts and
          extends their cortisol outputs. However, extroverts are buffered from
          the negative effects of childhood mobility, which was shown both from
          their subjective report of well-being and from their cortisol output.
          More study about how culture affects the individual need to be done.
          Other Factors as moderators Other factors, such as age differences and
          the individual’s self conception, might predict different levels of
          stress after moving. As for age, there is no single research studying
          housing mobility and its effect on mental health. However, data showed
          that older people generally experience less stress compared to adults
          (Jayson, 2013); this can be explained as older people and young adults
          adapt stress differently (Folkman. et. al., 1987), or older people
          live in a relatively steady life where there are not so many stressors
          presented (U.S Census Bureau, A, 2015). Folkman. et. al. (1987) showed
          younger people around 40 years old use more active and interpersonal
          forms of coping (such as seeking of social support) than older people
          around 69 years old, and older people used coping strategies that are
          more passive and intrapersonal (distancing, acceptance of
          responsibility) than younger people. This study may predict that
          younger people may have more difficulties with adjustment after a move
          because their need for social support, but older people cannot be
          affected much by moving. In another study Cohen and Wills (1985)
          showed that frequent movers felt happier when an person accurately
          perceived their personal selves, whereas non-movers felt happier when
          a partner accurately perceived their collective selves. Personal self
          is the self that is defined by personality traits, skills, and
          abilities; collective self is the self that is defined by group
          membership and social background. Specifically, personal selves are
          individual characteristics, and are more central to the
          self-definition of frequent movers than to that of non-movers and thus
          people who accurately perceive their personal selves felt happier
          after frequent moves; collective selves are more dependent on groups’s
          identity, and are happier without movings and breaking up with their
          groups. The self identity is shaped by environment and cultures.
          Therefore movers from different cultures predict different emotional
          outcomes (Oishi, Krochik, Roth, & Sherman, 2012). There are more
          diversity issues affecting the degree of stress, because this is a
          globalized issue and the world is changing dramatically. For example,
          social media may also help people buffer stress during the residential
          moves nowadays. Discussion The reviewed studies clearly show that
          residential mobility predicted prolonged stress, and in turn, less
          positive emotional outcomes. However, there is another study that
          showed an increase in well-being after a move (Kling et al., 1997;
          Smider, Essex, & Ryff, 1996), whereas other research found a decrease
          in well-being after a move (Larson, Bell, & Young, 2004). The studies
          that showed increase in well-being specified that the move was not
          frequent and it was a community relocation, which means that mover’s
          neighborhood were all moved together to a different place. This
          minimized stressors for the movers. One additional contributing factor
          for positive outcomes after moving can be explained by the cognitive
          theory of emotion as mentioned earlier. For example, during
          residential mobility, some people may experience short term stress,
          which leads to growth, adaptation, and new-learning (McEwen & Ginaros,
          2011). Other people may build a stress that is intense and prolonged,
          thus leading to allostatic load and influencing their mental health in
          a negative way. Even though moving may improve one’s happiness and
          well-being, however, moving provides a high risk environment for
          developing mental illness, especially for those who experience
          extremely unstable environments and for particular individual’s
          characteristics. Residential mobility is a stressful life event,
          people move to pursue a better future but underestimate the hidden
          stressors that exist in the new environment that could affect
          emotional health. In order to improve mental well-being outcomes for
          people who are experiencing frequent residential moves, more programs
          need to be supported in order to help movers extend social
          relationships into their local communities. Movers should be also
          educated that housing mobility leads to negative affects on mental
          health in order to get pre-movers to have enough mental preparation
          before moving. Educating movers is relatively easier to take into
          action in the communities. Movers who experienced frequent moves can
          lecture communities and teach the residents about the potential
          negative effects on people after moving. However, it is more difficult
          to help movers extend their social relationships into the new
          community. Programs should coordinate activities for new movers and
          solidify their relationship to the community ideally; however, movers
          might not get involved with the activities since the events are
          voluntary. For example, introverts who are affected negatively by
          moving might still prefer to stay in their comfort zone rather than
          reaching out, whereas extroverts would be more willing to join the
          social activities but they are not mentally affected much by moving.
          Therefore, establishing activities may not serve its purpose. It is
          not ethical to force movers, like introverts, to be members for the
          program. In order to help introverted movers cope with their stress,
          it may better serve them to have home visits regularly, provide them
          information about the resources in the new community and improve
          interpersonal communication. This is especially true for women,
          introverts, people who had moved a lot, experienced family
          instability, etc. Limitation There are several limitations: first,
          housing mobility is usually involved with many factors from children’s
          development. Every family has different a situation and it is
          difficult to form control groups, therefore, the result might be
          affected by that. Second, it is difficult to keep track of the
          families who move houses a lot, and as a result the most valuable
          results from moving families cannot be recorded. Third, the sample in
          most studies might not represent the total U.S population, because the
          population of movers tend to be not able to get involved in the
          studies. Last, there are not much researches about housing mobility
          had been done in a clinical setting. Most of the research about
          housing mobility and well-being are done by observation. The research
          relies on naturalistic data and bases on observing movers. There are
          not clinical trials about moving and its effect on emotions, because
          it is not ethical to let people move homes since moving can cause
          stress. Therefore, people are not able to see the results directly
          about how moving affects mental health in clinical experiments.
          Conclusion Overall, the research provides a number of contributions to
          the study of housing mobility and its affects on mental health. Stress
          is an essential factor that causes moving to predict negative mental
          health outcomes. Both “brain adaptations” and “social relationships”
          can vary the degree of stress. If the individual cannot adapt stress
          well in the new environment, they are more likely to build allostatic
          load and develop mental illness (McEwen & Gianaros, 2011). For
          example, introverts have built up cortisol output and are more
          stressed after moving whereas extroverts are not effected by moving
          (Oishi et. al., 2012). Other factors such as aging and self-identity
          also lead to different brain adaptation, which cause different mental
          health outcomes (Cohen and Wills, 1985). Additionally, intense
          instability in the social environment after moving (such as moving to
          a culturally different community, and with family instability) create
          intense stressors which are more difficult to cope with, therefore
          their mental health is more negatively affected by moving. References
